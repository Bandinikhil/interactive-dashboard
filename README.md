## Features

### Interactive Data Visualization
1. **Bar Chart:**
   - Represents features A, B, C, etc.
   - X-axis represents the total time spent within the selected date range.

2. **Line Chart:**
   - Displays the time trend of a specific category upon clicking on the bar chart.
   - Supports pan, zoom-in, and zoom-out options for the time range.

### Advanced Filtering
1. **Age Filter:**
   - Options: 15-25, >25.

2. **Gender Filter:**
   - Options: Male, Female.

3. **Date Range Selector:**
   - Allows users to choose a specific time range for analytics data.
   - Updates the graph based on the selected time range and filters.

### Cookie Management
   - Stores user preferences for filters and date range.
   - Retrieves previous settings from cookies on revisiting the page.
   - Provides an option for users to reset or clear their preferences.

### Responsiveness
   - Ensures seamless functionality on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

### User Authentication
   - Basic user login interface.
   - Users can sign up, log in, and log out.

### URL Sharing
   - Users can share a chart created with date range and filters via URL.
   - Second users must log in to view the chart due to confidential data.

## API Integration and Data Pipeline
   - An API integration layer and data pipeline are implemented to fetch and process data from the provided dataset.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-analytics-dashboard.git
   cd product-analytics-dashboard








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
